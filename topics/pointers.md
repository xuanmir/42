### Variable declaration
`[type_int] [variable_name]`
```c
int variable_name;
```

---
### Pointer declaration
`[type_int] [type_pointer] [pointer_name]`
```c
int *pointer_name;
```
```c
int* pointer_name;
```

---
### Pointer of pointer declaration
`[type_int] [type_pointer] [type_pointer] [pointer_name]`
```c
int **pointer_name;
```
```c
int** pointer_name;
```

---
### Variable referencing
`[pointer_name] = [address_of] [variable_name]`
`[pointer_name] = [reference_to] [variable_name]`
```c
pointer_name = &variable_name;
a_ptr = &a;
```

---
### Pointer referencing
`[pointer_name] = [address_of] [pointer_name]`
`[pointer_name] = [reference_to] [pointer_name]`
```c
pointer_name = &pointer_name;
ptr = &ptr; ????
```

---
```c
return (variable_name);
/*
Returns the value stored in [variable_name].
*/
```
```c
return (pointer_name);
/*
Returns the value stored in [pointer_name].
However, since [pointer_name] is a pointer,
the value will be an address to another [something_name]
thereforeâ€¦
Returns the address stored in [pointer_name].
*/
```
```c
return (*pointer_name);
/*
Returns the value found at the address stored in [pointer_name].
*/
```
```c
return (&pointer_name);
/*
Returns the address of [pointer_name].
*/
```

### Pointer dereferencing
Dereference: access, execute, expand, interpret, unwrap, etc.
