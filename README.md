# 42 Journey

### Things to clarify before the next exam
- Conversions between char and int.
- Declaration and assignation of character strings and integer arrays on separate lines.
- Global, static, constant (???).

### The Norm says
- Each C keyword must be followed by a space, except for keywords for types (such as int, char, float, etc.), as well as sizeof.
- Declaration and an initialisation cannot be on the same line, except for global variables (when allowed), static variables, and constants.
- Multiple assignments are strictly forbidden.
- You may add a new line after an instruction or control structure, but youâ€™ll have to add an indentation with brackets or assignment operator. Operators must be at the beginning of a line.
- Control structures (if, while..) must have braces, unless they contain a single line or a single condition.

### Character Strings

```c
array[index] == *(array + index)
```
```c
char  array[] = "Abcdef";
```
```c
char  array[size];

array[index] = 'a';
```

### Integer Arrays

```c
array[index] == *(array + index)
```
```c
int array[] = {#, #, #};
```
```c
int array[size];

array[index] = #;
